Actuated iPad Haptic Interface Device Objective:To create a haptic feedback system using a servo-actuated iPad to simulate 3D virtual landscapes and objects. This surface can also serve to demonstrate implemented feedback control via the “ball and plate” system.The software will be coded in Xcode, using the standard iPad emulator. The main components will include data acquisition (from built-in sensors), inverse kinematic calculation (using pre-defined landscapes), control command derivation, encoding and sending of the control command via the audio jack.
